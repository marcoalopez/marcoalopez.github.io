Welcome to my personal website. I’m Marco, a geoscientist at the Andalusian Earth Sciences Institute (IACT-CSIC) in Granada, Spain. My research focuses on the physical properties of solid Earth materials (rocks and minerals) using a combination of observational, experimental, and computational approaches. This includes, for example, how rocks respond to applied stress (deformation and rheology), how microstructure and crystal orientation influence mechanical properties and [sound wave propagation through rocks](https://marcoalopez.github.io/PyRockWave/). A large part of my work involves analyzing rock microstructures and crystal preferred orientation (CPO) using [electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_backscatter_diffraction) and image-analysis techniques. I also enjoy coding and actively support open-source and open-science practices, often developing tools and projects that connect programming with geoscience applications. More recently, I have been expanding my interests towards rock thermodynamic modelling, particularly using [Perple_X](https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/), and [Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier-transform_infrared_spectroscopy), as a way to expand my skillset and approach geological problems from complementary angles. Beyond my core research, this website also hosts other things I enjoy working on, such as teaching materials, manuals, and short pieces of writing.

# Teaching & Outreach

I previously taught at the University of Oviedo, where I was involved in several courses in the Geology and Mining Engineering degrees. These included *Structural Geology*, *Geological Mapping* (fieldwork and geological map interpretation), *Geodynamics*, *Plate Tectonics*, *Geophysical and Geochemical Prospecting*, and *Applied Geology for Engineering Problems*. For further details, please see my [CV](https://github.com/marcoalopez/marcoalopez.github.io/blob/master/Resume.pdf). When time allows, which is not often these days, I enjoy creating free educational material, such as workshops, short courses, and a variety of scientific notes. This includes Jupyter notebooks, videos, and short essays on a range of topics, mostly in English but occasionally in Spanish. Links to this material can be found below. I am not particularly active on social media, but I occasionally share brief thoughts and updates at https://fediscience.org/@marcoalopez  

## Workshops and courses

### **An introduction to the Python programming language for data analysis in the Earth sciences**

**Website**: https://github.com/marcoalopez/Python_course

## Media

I have a YouTube channel called *Earth Science Talks*, where I occasionally upload videos about my research. Please be aware that the topics covered so far are very niche and unlikely to be of interest to the general public. [Click here to visit the channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJwqroIMlqSED-K6heG_3GnSR7TQ5t77o). Below is the list of available videos:

https://colorbrewer2.org/: This color mapping tool produces color-blind-compliant color maps and warns users if their chosen colors will print correctly. These colour maps are already included in the Python ecosystem. For MATLAB, you can download them [here](https://es.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/45208-colorbrewer-attractive-and-distinctive-colormaps).

It's a must-have for me and anyone working on EBSD data in research. The developers are very responsive and are continually developing new features and fixing errors. It's also the only reason I still use MATLAB every now and then. There is a version ported to Python named [Orix](https://orix.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), but it's not quite ready to replace MTEX completely just yet. 

https://imagej.net/downloads: **Fiji** (derived from *ImageJ*) is a free, open-source software package designed for scientific image analysis. It is a jack-of-all-trades in this field.

[Zotero](): This is a free tool to collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research.

[Typora](https://typora.io/): I love writing in Markdown. I use it for everything, from quick notes to full documents. Typora is a minimalist Markdown editor and reader that I use often. Although it's not free, it's a one-time purchase with no subscription fees or renewals. This very website was created using Typora.
